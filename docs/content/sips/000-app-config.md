Summary: A configuration system for Spin applications.

Owner: lann.martin@fermyon.com

Created: March 22, 2022

## Background

It is common for applications to require configuration at runtime that isn't known at build time or is too sensitive to be stored with build artifacts.

A few examples:

- Logging configuration
- Per-channel (production, staging, etc) service dependency URLs
- Database secrets

## Proposal

### Configuration is a tree, with the app at its root

e.g.:
- app_key
- component1
  - key1
  - key2
- component2
  - key3
  - nested-component
    - key4

### Each key has a "path" corresponding to its position in the tree

- e.g. `component2.nested-component.key4`

- Config keys are restricted to allow unambiguous encoding as environment variables
  / file paths:
  - Start with a letter (required for env vars)
  - Only lowercase ascii alphanum and `-` (could be `_` instead but only one of those)
    - Only one `-` at a time (to allow joining paths as env vars with `__`)

### Configuration "schema" is defined by the app and components
```toml
[config] # [application.config]?
key1 = "default_value"
# ...is equivalent to:
key1 = { default = "default_value" }

# "required" fields must be given a value
key2 = { required = true }

# "secret" field values should be handled with care (e.g. not logged)
key3 = { required = true, secret = true }

[[component]]
id = "component1"
...
# Reusable components would define their config in their own component manifest
[[component.config]]
key1 = "value"  # Path: component1.key1
...
# Component dependency config can be overridden
[[component.dependencies.nested-component]]
key4 = "override"
```

### Configuration defaults can reference other keys
```toml
[config]
app_key = "app_value"
app_key2 = "prefix-{{ app_key }}-suffix"  # "prefix-app_value-suffix"

[[component.config]]
key1 = "value1"
# Component config can reference root (app) keys:
key2 = "root_ref={{ app_key }}"   # "root_ref=app_value"
# and its own keys:
key3 = "self_ref={{ .key1 }}"     # "self_ref=value1"

[[component.dependencies.nested-component.config]]
own_key = ""
# Dependency config can reference root, parent (dependant), and own keys:
root_ref = "{{ app_key }}"
parent_ref = "{{ ..key1 }}"
self_ref = "{{ .own_key }}
```

### Configuration "providers" populate configuration

_I haven't thought this through too much. Would this live in `spin.toml`? How is config resolved across multiple providers?_
```toml
[[config_provider]]
type = "toml_file"
path = "config.toml"

[[config_provider]]
type = "environment"
# Some config might not be appropriate for some providers
exclude = "component2.*"
```

#### Example providers

- Environment provider
  - `component2.nested-component.key4` -> `SPIN_APP__COMPONENT2__NESTED_COMPONENT__KEY4`
  - ðŸ˜¬ _Boy howdy thats ugly! Better ideas?_
- File provider
  ```toml
  [component2.nested-component]
  key4 = "value"
  ```
- Vault provider

### Configuration is exposed via component interface

`spin-config.wit`
```
// Missing key is a runtime error
get_config: function(key: string) -> string
```
- Since each component gets its own instance of the `spin-config` import, the executor can resolve paths automatically and only expose a component's own config to it.

### Other design options

#### Typed configuration

The above assumes only string values, but we could include some typing:
```toml
# Simple form is typed implicitly from its default value
string_key = "value"
string_key = { type = "string", default = "value" }

number_key = 123
number_key = { type = "number", default = 123 }

required_string = { type = "string", required = true }
# Would require e.g. base64 encoding in some places
encryption_key = { type = "bytes", required = true, secret = true}
```

- This would complicate everything for _us_ but is nicer for users.

#### WASI "configfs"

For languages without component support, we could expose config as synthetic mounted files:

```ruby
key1_value = File.read("/config/key1")

# Typed config
key1_value = JSON.parse(File.read("/config/key1.json"))

# "bytes" type
encryption_key = File.read("/config/encryption_key.raw")
```
